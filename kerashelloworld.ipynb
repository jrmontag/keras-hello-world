    "A few months ago, I started a new job doing applied research at Fast Forward Labs. My new colleagues had just finished a project on image recongition with convolutional neural networks, and were starting on a new project on text summarization with recurrent neural networks. Neural networks were not something I'd previously worked with, so I knew I'd have to get up to speed fast.\n",

Among the many great things about Scikit-learn, my favourite is its simple, coherent and consistent API, which is built around `Estimator` objects.
